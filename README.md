#Home serve now

This project has both backend and frontend components.

There are parts on the frontend that are not implemented ( adding a new tradesperson and choosing a job ).

The whole project can be started by downloading and installing docker.

Then running `docker-compose up` should start a mongodb instance + the backend + the frontend running on: `localhost:3000`

The proxy between the two was not implemented.
